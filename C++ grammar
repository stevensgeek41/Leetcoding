1. vector
vector<int> a(n):          make a vector's size to be n and initialize it with 0
use push_back to add new element to the vector. never use [] to add value to a vector

2. string
string s1;           create an empty string (with 1 '\0' at the end)

3. new
TreeNode* rootPtr = new TreeNode(val);      it's that easy
