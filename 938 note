On Leetcode Input:
Leetcode's input is not necessarily the input of your function.

On BST:
BST is not necessarily a complete binary tree.
You should get used to the input parameter of treeNode* or something like that, don't overthink about it as an array.

On recursion:
Recursion can make your code easier to write, yet slower to run. 
In leetcode, your function will be called multiple times for testing, so don't use a static variable.
You can return the right sum using only local variables.
