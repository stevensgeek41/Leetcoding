On 2-D string matrix in C
1. you can ignore the first dimension if all the string elements are already known when initialized.
2. otherwise you need to explicitly set the first and second dimension

On strcat(str1,str2)
1. connect two strings, then save it in the first string

On counting different types of string in one group
1. the key is to judge if its two strings are same, if true, then ignore that string. This methhod can be reused under similar circumstances.
